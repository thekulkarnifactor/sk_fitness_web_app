<!-- Organization Schema -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "House of Macros",
  "description": "AI-powered meal planning and delivery for athletes",
  "url": "https://houseofmacros.com",
  "logo": "https://houseofmacros.com/logo.png",

    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "House of Macros"

## Content Readability Best Practices

### Sentence Length Guidelines

| Length | Rating | Usage |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 1-10 words | Excellent | Headlines, CTAs, emphasis |
| 11-20 words | Good | Body content, descriptions |
| 21-25 words | Acceptable | Complex ideas, but limit use |
| 26+ words | Poor | Break into multiple sentences |

**Your Current Average**: 18 words ✅
**Target**: 15 words for optimal web readability

---

### Paragraph Structure

**Web Reading Rules:**
- **Maximum**: 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- **Ideal**: 2-3 sentences (40-60 words)
- **Mobile**: Shorter is better (1-2 sentences)

**Current Issues:**
- About page: 3-sentence paragraphs (good!)
- Home page: Some long descriptions (needs breaking)

**Example Fix:**

```
❌ BEFORE (Dense):
"House of Macros brings together professional chefs with decades of
culinary experience, certified nutritionists who understand sports
performance, and developers who've built AI systems to make
personalization seamless."

✅ AFTER (Scannable):
"House of Macros brings together the best talent:

• Professional chefs with decades of experience
• Certified sports nutritionists
• AI developers who make personalization seamless

Three experts. One perfect meal."

Improvement: Converted 30-word sentence into bulleted list + punchy close
```

---

### Active Voice Optimization

**Target**: 95%+ active voice

**Common Passive Constructions to Avoid:**

```
❌ "Meals are designed to fuel"
✅ "Meals fuel your training"

❌ "Ingredients are sourced daily"
✅ "We source ingredients daily"

❌ "Your nutrition should be tailored"
✅ "Tailor your nutrition"

❌ "Food should be performance-driven"
✅ "Performance-driven food"
```

**Quick Test**: If you can add "by zombies" after the verb, it's passive!

---

### Reading Level Optimization

**Target**: 8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid 8.0)

**Current Status**:
- Home: 10.2 grade ⚠️
- About: 11.3 grade ❌
- Calculator: 7.8 grade ✅

**How to Lower Reading Level:**

1. **Shorter words** (1-2 syllables preferred)
   - "utilize" → "use"
   - "personalization" → "custom fit"
   - "athletic pursuit" → "sport"

2. **Shorter sentences** (under 20 words)

3. **Simple structure** (subject-verb-object)

4. **Avoid jargon**
   - "macro-balanced" → "balanced macros" (more conversational)
   - "culinary experience" → "cooking expertise"

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. ✅ Update page titles and meta descriptions
